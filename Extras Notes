# Notes — SQL Case Study 1

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Practiced **JOINs** (INNER JOIN) to connect FactTable with LocationTable.
- Applied **GROUP BY** with aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) for market, state, and market size analysis.
- Used **ORDER BY DESC** to highlight top-performing markets and states.
- Learned how to structure queries systematically (Task01 → Task29).
- Improved confidence in handling **real-world datasets** with multiple dimensions.

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced
- Difference between **SUM vs AVG** in business analysis.
- Importance of **MarketSize** dimension (Large, Medium, Small).
- How **Budgeted vs Actual values** (Sales, COGS, Margin) are compared in reporting.
- Role of **screenshots** as proof of execution.

## 🚀 Personal Takeaway
This case study helped me strengthen:
- Query writing speed and accuracy.
- Documentation skills (README + repo structure).
- Portfolio building for recruiters.
