Notes for consistency
- Labels: Keep exact filenames Task01.sql … Task29.sql to match your screenshots.
- Columns: If your fact table uses different names (e.g., Budget_COGS, Marketing_Expenses), replace in queries.
- Ordering: DESC prioritizes top performers; change to ASC if you need lowest-first.
Want me to add headers/comments at the top of each SQL file (Task number, purpose, columns used) so it looks extra polished?
